# Learning the Basics of Unity

## Overview

In this project, you will first learn the basics of Unity by completing a
Driving Simulator. Then, you will apply what you learned while creating that
driving simulator to fix and implement a Flying Simulator.

## Setting up Unity

### Create a Unity Account

To use Unity, you are required to have a developer license. The basic developer license is free and can be acquired by simply creating an account on Unity's official website: [https://unity.com/](https://unity.com/)

From this page, click the icon in the top right of the page and then click the `Create a Unity ID` link (or if you already have a Unity ID click Sign in).

### Download Unity Hub

After you have your account, you will need to download Unity Hub: [https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).

You should click the `Download Unity Hub` button here, not the `Choose your Unity + download` button.

### Login to Unity Hub and Create a License

Now that you have Unity Hub installed, you must login and register a license. Launch Unity Hub, click the icon in the top right and select Sign in.

After you've logged in, you can now click on the same icon and select Manage license.

![Manage License](README/ManageLicense.png)

From this page, select `Activate New License`, select `Unity Personal`, `I don't use Unity in a professional capacity.`, then click `Done`.

### Download and Install Unity

Next you need to download the `Unity Installer` for `Unity 2020.x` for your operating system from the Unity download archive: [https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)

![Unity Installer](README/UnityInstaller.png)

This will download the `Unity Download Assistant`. If you're prompted to select components to install, you only need install `Unity 2020.1.xyz`. Note, that the `xyz` here will be different for you when you get to this point.

You do not need to select any other components. However, you may wish to select Linux, Mac, WebGL, and Windows Build support if you wish to export as an executable. Note: You may install these components at a later time if you wish.
